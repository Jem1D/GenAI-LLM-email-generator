# AI-Powered Cold Email Generator for Job Seekers

This project is designed to help job seekers automatically generate personalized cold emails tailored to job postings. Built with LangChain, Groq LLM, Playwright, Streamlit, and ChromaDB, it leverages a resume-based project portfolio to intelligently match relevant experience with job listings and craft professional emails in seconds.

## How It Works

1. **User pastes a job listing URL** (e.g., from LinkedIn, Adobe Careers, etc.).
2. The app **scrapes and cleans the job content** using Playwright and BeautifulSoup.
3. It **extracts structured role data** (role, skills, experience, and description) using an LLM chain.
4. Based on the job details, it performs a **semantic search over your project portfolio** stored in ChromaDB.
5. It uses another LLM prompt to **generate a cold outreach email**, referencing the most relevant projects.
6. The email is rendered directly in the Streamlit app.
